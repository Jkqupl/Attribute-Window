                <p>Welcome to the make your own attribute window website. Have you always wanted a way to gamify your life to track your progress? Well look
                    no further!! Here you can make your own attribute window that tracks whatever you want it to. Every stat starts from level 1 and to upgrade your stats
                    increase your points! You do this by actively practising in the real world and then adding a point to the stat through the website. Once a stat gets
                    7 points , the level increases by 1! Make sure to be honest with yourself (Or don't I dont really care :). Good Luck !!!!
